            Hey guys, I’m sad to say that this post isn’t coming from Granny Barbara herself. This is her “tech savvy” grandson who put this all together for her. You may have noticed that she hasn’t posted anything in a couple months, and that's because she’s ended up in the hospital due to her bad joints. The doctors say that it was from a lot of stress and moving, but I say it's a direct result of this website. If I had known better, I would never have let her move off of her MySpace and onto this forsaken place of idiots. Idiots who don’t even know how to utilize the search engine that they used to get onto the site in the first place! I mean you had this poor old grandma using the car that's been sitting in her garage for the past twenty years to go and figure out how to replace all types of flour in her famous cakes! At that point, maybe it's not for you. Next time before you “unknowingly” harass a poor grandma, go ahead and log off. Not everything needs to be about you, because all know that Granny Barbara made everything about others.

            <div class="new-line">Happy Love Month y’all! I just wanted to come on here and sort some things out because I honestly and truthfully did not expect the reaction I got from that last post. After talking it out with some of my younger kids, I understand where I went wrong. I shouldn’t have come on that strong with you youngins, and allowing you all to go off without direction was not the best idea, as like me and my friends used to say, “Too many cooks spoil the gravy.” Instead, Granny Barbara let go of your hand, and this I shouldn’t have thought you were ready for.</div>

            Going forward, I’m not going to make that mistake again. For the person who asked what to do if you were allergic to beans under my chili recipe, I’d recommend replacing them with lentils. Even though that one was easy to figure out, a couple of these other comments have me in a tizzy! Even though I’m not as mobile as I used to be, I think I’m ready to step out of my comfort zone to go get these exotic ingredients. Maybe I’m not the best person for this job, but it seems like I’m your last line of reason. Rest assured, I won’t leave y'all's sides again.

            Happy New Year! I’m so glad to see a new year these days, my back has been getting particularly bad and who knows with how my knees have been progressing. Anyway, y’all have put me in a pickle getting all these recipes out. I didn’t realize how many picky kids there would be in these big families but whew! All these special requests have been like putting a cat in a turtleneck sweater! Hopefully the coming months will be a little bit easier on my joints. I do have one thing to ask, however, and that's to get those typing hands together and click clack on your trusty phones for any other ingredients that would be good for specifications. I do like talking to y’all in the comments, so don’t stop. Hopefully I figure out some Valentine’s recipes that’ll be able satiate the fire in your bellies that yearns for more.

            Happy Turkey Month! I’ve been so excited to be able to share all of my recipes with such nice people. This website has been the best thing for me recently, and I am so happy with how things are turning out. Your comments under my recipes have been very enlightening, and I never thought to try and replace the pumpkin in a pumpkin pie. Fret not, this is not the only change to come in these festive months. But I do ask for you to be a little nice with me, since I am getting up there in years. I hope to have the turkey recipe finished by the 16th, since I know most of y’all youngins have busy lives around Thanksgiving. Hopefully you all can continue on with these recipes without modification, since I do know there are some picky kids in some families. See you soon, Granny Barbara!

            <div class="new-line">Hi everyone! You can call me Granny Barbara, and this is going to be my new website for recipes. I may not be the most tech savvy, but my grandson sure is, so this is new for me! I just wanted to come on here and make a little blog section so that I could get to know you and you could get to know me. If you have any comments be sure to leave them with the nifty little thing my dear grandson whipped up!</div>

            Some things about myself before I get to cooking for all of y’all: My name is Barbara, and I am 63 years old. I’m a widow with a lot of time on my hands and love to cook. My family says I’m a very accepting person and I hope to make that known in my cooking. Even though I may be older, I can still change my ways and I know where my input is wanted and needed. I hope to make family for everyone, and food that everyone can enjoy, even if it is not all one type.
