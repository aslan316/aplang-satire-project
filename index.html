            Happy New Year! I’m so glad to see a new year these days, my back has been getting particularly bad and who knows with how my knees have been progressing. Anyway, y’all have put me in a pickle getting all these recipes out. I didn’t realize how many picky kids there would be in these big families but whew! All these special requests have been like putting a cat in a turtleneck sweater! Hopefully the coming months will be a little bit easier on my joints. I do have one thing to ask, however, and that's to get those typing hands together and click clack on your trusty phones for any other ingredients that would be good for specifications. I do like talking to y’all in the comments, so don’t stop. Hopefully I figure out some Valentine’s recipes that’ll be able satiate the fire in your bellies that yearns for more.

            Happy Turkey Month!!! I’ve been so excited to be able to share all of my recipes with such nice people. This website has been the best thing for me recently, and I am so happy with how things are turning out. Your comments under my recipes have been very enlightening, and I never thought to try and replace the pumpkin in a pumpkin pie. Fret not, this is not the only change to come in these festive months. But I do ask for you to be a little nice with me, since I am getting up there in years. I hope to have the turkey recipe finished by the 16th, since I know most of y’all youngins have busy lives around Thanksgiving. Hopefully you all can continue on with these recipes without modification, since I do know there are some picky kids in some families. See you soon, Granny Barbara!

            <div class="new-line">Hi everyone! You can call me Granny Barbara, and this is going to be my new website for recipes. I may not be the most tech savvy, but my grandson sure is, so this is new for me! I just wanted to come on here and make a little blog section so that I could get to know you and you could get to know me. If you have any comments be sure to leave them with the nifty little thing my dear grandson whipped up!</div>

            Some things about myself before I get to cooking for all of y’all: My name is Barbara, and I am 63 years old. I’m a widow with a lot of time on my hands and love to cook. My family says I’m a very accepting person and I hope to make that known in my cooking. Even though I may be older, I can still change my ways and I know where my input is wanted and needed. I hope to make family for everyone, and food that everyone can enjoy, even if it is not all one type.
